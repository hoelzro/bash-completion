=method should_activate

The method C<should_activate()> is used by the automatic setup of
completion rules in the .bashrc.

When collecting plugins to activate, the system calls this method. If
this method returns false, the default, the plugin is not used.

A common implementation of this method is to check the PATH for the
command we want to provide completion, and return true only if that
command is found.

=cut

sub should_activate {return}


=method generate_bash_setup

This method should generate the bash commands to enable completion for
the commands the plugin targets.

For example, something like:

    complete -C "bash-complete cmd Perldoc" perldoc

This will execute C<bash-complete cmd Perldoc> to complete the
C<perldoc> command. The C<Perldoc> string is the plugin name.

sub generate_bash_setup {return}
